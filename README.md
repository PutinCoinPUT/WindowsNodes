# WindowsNodes

Here you can clone/download the Windows-Node Wallets for PUTinCoin:

PutinCoin-qt.exe.zip = Windows GUI Node Wallet (this is the wallet, most of you use in Windows!!)<br />
putincoind.exe.zip = Wincows CLI Node Wallet

Download, extract and run!

The new "CLI Node wallet" must be run from terminal and can be started by background service, if wished. It has been developed for server usage (like setting up a Windows server node for API connection to the PUT blockchain). Normal Windows users should stick to the "GUI Node Wallet".

IMPORTANT: Especially on Windows it might be, that your Virus Software doesn't like the PUT-Walletapp and may block it after unzipping or prevent execution.

Don't be afraid, the wallet software is completely clean but it needs to open a stable connection to the internet for connecting with the PUT-Blockchain.

Most Virus Software don't like this so you must WHITELIST the PUT-Walletapp within your Virus Software or DEACTVATE your Virus Software for the PUT-Walletapp (especially Windows Security center, which might already block the download of the Windows wallet) to guarantee a flawless functionality of the wallet!!

Here you can clone/download the Windows-Node Wallet for PUTinCoin:

PutinCoin-qt.exe.zip = Windows GUI Node Wallet<br />
putincoind.exe.zip = Wincows CLI Node Wallet

Download, extract and run!

The new CLI wallet must be run from terminal and can be started by background service, if wished.

IMPORTANT: Especially on Windows it might be, that your Virus Software doesn't like the PUT-Walletapp and may block it after unzipping or prevent execution.

Don't be afraid, the wallet software is completely clean but it needs to open a stable connection to the internet for connecting with the PUT-Blockchain.

Most Virus Software don't like this so you must WHITELIST the PUT-Walletapp within your Virus Software or DEACTVATE your Virus Software for the PUT-Walletapp (especially Windows Security center, which might already block the download of the Windows wallet) to guarantee a flawless functionality of the wallet!!
